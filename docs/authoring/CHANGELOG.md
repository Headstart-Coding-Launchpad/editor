# Lesson Authoring Changelog

Author-facing changes that affect how lessons, tasks, topics, checks, assets, or lesson Markdown should be written.

Use this changelog when a platform or documentation change alters the lesson authoring contract. Keep entries newest first and link to the deeper reference doc when the change needs examples or field-level detail.

## What belongs here

- New, renamed, deprecated, or removed lesson YAML/JSON fields.
- New or changed task types, module types, quiz types, checks, feedback checks, or Markdown syntax.
- CLI validation, conversion, publishing, topic, or asset workflow changes that affect authors.
- Builder behavior changes that alter what lesson authors can save, validate, publish, or migrate.
- Compatibility notes for older lessons when authors need to update source files.

## What does not belong here

- Internal refactors with no author-facing lesson behavior change.
- UI polish that does not affect saved lesson fields or authoring workflow.
- Test-only, tooling-only, or deployment-only changes that authors do not need to know about.

### Added `taskActivity` field; authoring intent now previewable

Tasks may now carry an optional `taskActivity` field — a plain-text, author-only note on the intended in-class activity (e.g. "Pair-share discussion"). Like `intent`, it is stored but never shown to students, and it is always optional (not required in Draft). It rides along under the existing generic `taskLastChangedAt` timestamp; it has no dedicated `taskActivityLastChangedAt`.

Authoring intent (and the new `taskActivity`) are now also visible in the Builder's inline student/quiz preview and in the teacher's full read-only lesson preview, in an "Authoring metadata" section above the student-facing content. This section is visible by default while `lesson.draft: true`, and collapsed (one click to expand) once Draft is cleared. Both fields remain strictly author-only in every case — never rendered on any student-facing render path.

See `docs/authoring/lesson-schema.md` and `docs/authoring/lesson-schema-yaml.md` for the field reference.

### Changed grouped subtask titles

Grouped subtasks now keep their own `title` values instead of being auto-renamed from the parent group title. Authors no longer need `_customTitle`; Builder saves and exports strip that legacy field from grouped subtasks.

See `docs/authoring/lesson-schema-yaml.md` for the updated group example.

### Added authoring changelog maintenance rule

The authoring docs now include this changelog for future lesson-writing changes. When a change affects how lessons are authored, update this file in the same PR with:

- the author-facing impact;
- any required migration or compatibility note;
- links to the detailed reference docs that were updated.

This entry introduces the process only; it does not change the lesson schema or publishing workflow.
